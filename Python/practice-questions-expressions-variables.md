# Python Practice Questions – Expressions & Variables

## Overview
Original practice questions and answers to reinforce Python expressions, variables, numeric operations, and string handling.

### Question 1 — Numeric Expressions
What will the following Python code output?

```python
a = 24
b = 6
result = a / b
print(result)
```

Answer: `4.0`  
Explanation: `/` always performs floating-point division in Python.

### Question 2 — Integer (Floor) Division
What is printed when this code runs?

```python
x = 7
y = 2
print(x // y)
```

Answer: `3`  
Explanation: `//` returns the floor (integer) portion of the division.

### Question 3 — Printing Multiple Strings
What will this code display?

```python
w1 = "Learning"
w2 = "Python"
w3 = "is"
w4 = "fun"

print(w1, w2, w3, w4)
```

### Question 4 — Variable Reassignment
What value will be printed?

```python
score = 10
score = score + 5
print(score)
```

Answer: `15`  
Explanation: The variable is reassigned to its previous value plus 5.
